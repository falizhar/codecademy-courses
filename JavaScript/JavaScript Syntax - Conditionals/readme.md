### **1. Magic 8 Ball**

   You’ve learned a powerful tool in JavaScript: control flow! It’s so powerful, in fact, that it can be used to tell someone’s fortune.
   
   In this project we will build the [Magic 8 Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball) using control flow in JavaScript.
   
   The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.
   
### **2. Race Day**

   Codecademy’s annual race is just around the corner! This year, we have a lot of participants. You have been hired to write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.

   As a timeline, registration would look like this:

   Here’s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

**Race number**:
- Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
- All others receive a number below 1000.

**Start time**:
- Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
- Early adults run at 9:30 am.
- Late adults run at 11:00 am.
- Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).

   **For runners that are exactly 18, should see the registration desk.**
